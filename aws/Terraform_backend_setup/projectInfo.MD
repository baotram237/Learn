# My project to build Terraform backend setup on AWS
# Components:
# 1. S3 bucket to store Terraform state file
# 2. DynamoDB table to lock the state file
# 3. IAM user with programmatic access to manage the state file
# 4. IAM policy to allow the user to manage the state file
# 5. IAM policy to allow the user to access the DynamoDB table
# 6. IAM policy to allow the user to access the S3 bucket
# 7. KMS key to encrypt the state file

# Steps:
# 1. Create an S3 bucket
# 2. Create a DynamoDB table
# 3. Create an IAM user
# 4. Create an IAM policy to allow the user to manage the state file
# 5. Create an IAM policy to allow the user to access the DynamoDB table
# 6. Create an IAM policy to allow the user to access the S3 bucket
# 7. Create a KMS key
# 8. Attach the policies to the user
# 9. Configure the backend in the Terraform configuration file
# 10. Initialize the backend
# 11. Apply the configuration
# 12. Verify the state file is stored in the S3 bucket
# 13. Verify the state file is encrypted with the KMS key
# 14. Verify the state file is locked in the DynamoDB table
